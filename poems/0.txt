Hello Readers,
Welcome to this Node.js server !!

I am using ReadStream and WriteStream to read poems in .txt format from server side
and then pipe it to return to you, client side in text format!

use local-host:port number/poem number to get poems
eg: 127.0.0.1:3000/1

Note: request from 1-13 to get 13 different poems as a demo!
